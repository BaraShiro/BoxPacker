# Box Packer
A Python implementation of the [largest differencing method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_differencing_method) as a solution to the [multiway number partitioning problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_number_partitioning) that I wrote for a coding interview. It takes the form of a packer that packs articles of a varying weight as evenly as possible into a certain number of boxes.

### Usage
To run the algorithm run the function `pack` from [BoxPacker.py](BoxPacker.py) with a supplied list of articles and a number of boxes.

To run the benchmark run the function `run_benchmark` from [Benchmark.py](Benchmark.py).
